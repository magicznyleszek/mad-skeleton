    <h3><a name="toc-modules-area"></a>area</h3>

    <p><code>&lt;div i-area="charcoal medium-v"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>

    <p>Area has two functions: setting the colors (background & text) and paddings.</p>

    <p>There are three sizes for spacing: <code>medium</code>, <code>half</code> and <code>double</code>. While defining paddings use optional <code>-v</code> and <code>-h</code> suffixes for setting only vertical (top & bottom) or horizontal (left & right) spacing.</p>

    <p>There are no single-side modifiers (top, bottom, left and right), as we want to keep the leading flow of the document pristine and we also try to follow <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/learning-from-lego-a-step-forward-in-modular-web-design">The LEGO Way</a> of handling spacing of stuff.</p>
